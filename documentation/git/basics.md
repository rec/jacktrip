# JackTrip git basics

A typical developer working on JackTrip will have to learn very little about git.

There are half a dozen steps that need to be done once, and then a half dozen
simple commands that are used every day.

I like to explain why everything works, because I find it's much more
entertaining that way, as well as being easier to remember, but you can skip
all that and jump right to the answer at the back the book.

## Do I need to learn to rebase?

Git has a technique called rebasing that has a bad reputation.

This workflow does not require you, the reader, to learn how to rebase.
Someone on the team will have to be able to rebase in some cases, but usually
these rebases will be automatic.

## If it's just a few commands, what is all this other stuff?

People will make mistakes.

Two developers will change the same line of code in different branches at
around the same time.

It's good to have instructions to deal with unusual cases.

## How do I get started?

1. Set up once on github: github.md
2. Set up the machine you are working on: setting-up.md
3.

# JackTrip git basics

A typical developer working on JackTrip will have to learn very little about
git.

The git setup is half a dozen steps, then a handful of commands used day-to-day.

## Rebasing?

When multiple developers work at the same time, their results need to be
merged.

Git's technique to handle this, _rebasing_,  can sometimes occasionally
tricky. This workflow does not require you, the reader, to learn how to
rebase, though you can learn how to rebase through it.

Someone on the team will have to be able to rebase in some cases, but usually
these rebases will be automatic.

## Getting started

1. Set up an account on github: github.md
2. Set up the machine you are working on one: setting-up.md
3. Work: workflow.md
4. If you like, read the "git without fear" document

And that's it!

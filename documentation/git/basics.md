# JackTrip git basics

A typical developer working on JackTrip will have to learn very little about
git.

The setup is half a dozen steps, and then there are not even a
half dozen simple commands used nearly all the time.

## If it's just a few commands, what is all this other stuff?

People will make mistakes.

Two developers will correctly change the same line of code in different places
at the same time.

It's good to have instructions to deal with unusual cases.

## Do I need to learn to rebase?

Git has a technique called rebasing that has a bad reputation.

This workflow does not require you, the reader, to learn how to rebase.
Someone on the team will have to be able to rebase in some cases, but usually
these rebases will be automatic.

## How do I get started?

1. Set up once on github: github.md
2. Set up the machine you are working on one: setting-up.md
3. Workflow - how you go about your day: workflow.md
4. If you like, read the "git without fear" document

And that's it!

# Setting up to use Git for JackTrip development

These instructions are for Unix-like systems - they might work also on Cygwin
on Windows.

## A. Forking the JackTrip GitHub repository

1. If you don't have a github account, create one [here](https://github.com/).

2. Now we're going to create a _fork_, which is a copy of the main JackTrip
    project in your own account for you to work on!

3.  Go to the main JackTrip page, https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip

4. Near the top right corner of that page there is a little button
    labelled "Fork".  Click it.  If you have multiple github accounts or
    organizations you belong to, you can choose one here.

5. Github goes off and creates the new fork for you.

6. Now your browser will be on the main Github page for your personal fork.
    As you develop, you will be doing it on your own _branches_ which can be
    reached from this page.  You might want to bookmark this!

7. You only have to do this step once, ever.

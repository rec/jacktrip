# Setting up GitHub for JackTrip development

1. If you don't have a github account, create one [here](https://github.com/).

2. Now create a _fork_, which is a copy of the main JackTrip repository in your
   own account.  You should do this even if you expect to do most of your work
   on the main fork.

3.  Go to the JackTrip fork, https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip

4. Near the top right corner of that page there is a little button
    labelled "Fork".  Click it.  (If you already had multiple github accounts or
    organizations you belong to, you can choose one here.)

5. Github goes off and creates the new fork for you, taking 30 seconds or so.

6. Now your browser will be on the main Github page for your personal fork.  You
    might want to bookmark this page, which will look like
    `https://github.com/<your-user-id>/jacktrip`.

    This is "your fork".  https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip is the jacktrip
    fork, or the main fork.
